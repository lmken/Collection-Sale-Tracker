~ Collection Sales Tracker ~

In it's current state, this program takes in a contract address and visualizes the latest 100 transactions on a scatter plot.
A couple key pieces of tech that are used to achieve this are the Helius API and MatPlotLib.
This is definitely more of a small feature, but I decided to build it out for fun so that one day I can come back to it and
continue making it more robust. Perhaps it will one day be integrated in an app as a feature.

Plans:

- Make a Twitter sales bot out of the Helius API
- Add some more graph options
- Add the ability for user input to be given
